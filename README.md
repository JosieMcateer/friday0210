# What was the challenge?
Write a class with a method inside that takes in an Integer for a value between 1 - 999. The method should take the number and convert it to the corresponding number in plain english. E.g. If the method takes the parameter 73, it will return the value "Seventy three".

 Stretch Goals
Increase the range from 1 - 9999.


# How i expected this to go?
I expected to struggle a bit, i have liked CSharp but there is a lot of principles behind it. We only used the switch statement and % the modulas operator a few times so i wasnt sure how it would go.


# What went well?
Once i started and understood how to do it using switch it didn`t take long at all. i formatted it so i understood and if i look back then i can understand my work.
I used the switch statement using our code we did in academy yesterday. I did the stretch goals 1-9999 & i added an extra statement that if it isnt between 1-9999 then it will say "invalid mumber".

I used an if statement for the invald number and used a few different learnings from academy this week which i think went well and shows my understanding

# What didnt go as planned?
My code is qute long, i believe using an if statement it could probablybe shorter? however this is the way that i understood so i decided to do it to practise my "switch" and modulas operator use. 


# Possible improvements for the future:
For the future i believe i could look at using different methods- if else to see if i can make my code more compact.
